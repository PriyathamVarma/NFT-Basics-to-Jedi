This repo is for showing basic implementation of NFTs(ERC-721 tokens) using openZeppelin


NFTs are unique and are owned by owners address. These can be used for real estate, voting rights and other self containing stuff. 

### Use of metadata

### Use of Enumerable

Check the balance of account on how many NFTs an account has.

### Use of URIStorage

Posibility to associate metadata to the NFTs.

The ERC721URIStorage contract is an implementation of ERC721 that includes the metadata standard extensions (IERC721Metadata) as well as a mechanism for per-token metadata. That’s where the _setTokenURI method comes from: we use it to store an item’s metadata.



## Prerequesties

- We need a smart contract to deploy the NFT tokens
- Solidity is the language of prefernce
- Service Provider Node - Alchemy, Infura
- Test tokens to pay gas fees
